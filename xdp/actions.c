/* OVS Datapath Execution
 * ======================
 *
 * When a lookup is successful the eBPF gets a list of actions to be
 * executed,  such as outputting the packet to a certain port, or
 * pushing a VLAN tag.  The list of actions is configured in ovs-vswitchd
 * and may be a variable length depending on the desired network processing
 * behaviour. For example, an L2 switch doing unknown broadcast sends
 * packet to all its current ports. The OVS datapathâ€™s actions is derived
 * from the OpenFlow action specification and the OVSDB schema for
 * ovs-vswitchd.
